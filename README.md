## Usage of const keyword and & operator

### Constant Variables:

It's used to declare constant variable which cannot ever be changed all over the project

```markdown
    const int y = 10; // how to declare it
```
### Const Keyword With Pointer Variables:
there are three possible ways to use a const keyword with a pointer, which are as follows:
####1. pointer variable point to a const value:
```markdown
int x{ 10 };
const int* i = &x;// how to declare it 
```
here i is a pointer variable that is pointing to a memory location const int-type, but the value stored at this corresponding location can be changed.
